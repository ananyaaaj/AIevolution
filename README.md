📊 AI Impact on Workload Across Industries –
Data Cleaning & Analysis
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is affecting workload patterns across various industries. It involves detailed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

🧠 Objective
To understand the shift in workload (increase/decrease) due to the adoption of AI in multiple sectors by cleaning and analyzing a real-world dataset.
